# File-Name-prediction
## By Shreya Shetty Atmakuri and RJ Joyce
For our project, we built a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) autoencoder model that predicts the name of a Python file given its source code. A seq2seq autoencoder is used to convert one type of data sequence into another type. For example, they have commonly been used to translate sentences from one language into another. Our seq2seq autoencoder model will translate from a sequence of tokens from Python source code into a sequence of english characters (the file name).
